## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Run static server
The HTML is generated at build time and will be reused on each request. It's great because the pages can be pre-rendered ahead of a user's request. You can also use it with Client-side Rendering to bring in additional data.

```bash
npm run build
npm run export
npm run serve
```
